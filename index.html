                      An Eagle was soaring through the air when suddenly it heard<br>
the whizz of an Arrow, and felt itself wounded to death.  Slowly<br>
it fluttered down to the earth, with its life-blood pouring out of<br>
it.  Looking down upon the Arrow with which it had been pierced,<br>
it found that the shaft of the Arrow had been feathered with one<br>
of its own plumes.  "Alas!" it cried, as it died,<br><br>

                  A slave named Androcles once escaped from his master and fled
to the forest.  As he was wandering about there he came upon a<br>
Lion lying down moaning and groaning.  At first he turned to flee,
but finding that the Lion did not pursue him, he turned back and<br>
went up to him.  As he came near, the Lion put out his paw, which
was all swollen and bleeding, and Androcles found that a huge<br>
thorn had got into it, and was causing all the pain.  He pulled
out the thorn and bound up the paw of the Lion, who was soon able<br>
to rise and lick the hand of Androcles like a dog.  Then the Lion
took Androcles to his cave, and every day used to bring him meat<br>
from which to live.  But shortly afterwards both Androcles and the
Lion were captured, and the slave was sentenced to be thrown to<br>
the Lion, after the latter had been kept without food for several
days.  The Emperor and all his Court came to see the spectacle,<br>
and Androcles was led out into the middle of the arena.  Soon the
Lion was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring<br>
towards his victim.  But as soon as he came near to Androcles he
recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands<br>
like a friendly dog.  The Emperor, surprised at this, summoned
Androcles to him, who told him the whole story.  Whereupon the<br>
slave was pardoned and freed, and the Lion let loose to his native
forest.<br><br>

                    <p style="font-family: 'Reenie Beanie', cursive;">
                  It happened that a Dog had got a piece of meat and was<br>
carrying it home in his mouth to eat it in peace.  Now on his way<br>
home he had to cross a plank lying across a running brook.  As he<br>
crossed, he looked down and saw his own shadow reflected in the<br>
water beneath.  Thinking it was another dog with another piece of<br>
meat, he made up his mind to have that also.  So he made a snap at<br>
the shadow in the water, but as he opened his mouth the piece of<br>
meat fell out, dropped into the water and was never seen more.<br><br>

"<i style="color:#82E0AA">Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.</i>"</p></div>

their hearts' desire.  Now the one was full of avarice, and the
other eaten up with envy.  So to punish them both, Jupiter granted
that each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on
condition that his neighbour had twice as much.  The Avaricious
man prayed to have a room full of gold.  No sooner said than done;
but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his
neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal.  Then came the
turn of the Envious man, who could not bear to think that his
neighbour had any joy at all.  So he prayed that he might have one
of his own eyes put out, by which means his companion would become
totally blind.<br><br>

                  <p style="width:30%; font-family: 'Merienda', cursive; font-size: 1.3em; line-height: 200%;">An old man on the point of death summoned his sons around him
to give them some parting advice.  He ordered his servants to
bring in a faggot of sticks, and said to his eldest son: "Break
it."  The son strained and strained, but with all his efforts was
unable to break the Bundle.  The other sons also tried, but none
of them was successful.  "Untie the faggots," said the father,
"and each of you take a stick."  When they had done so, he called
out to them: "Now, break," and each stick was easily broken.  "You
see my meaning," said their father.<br><br>
